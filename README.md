# Better KeepInventory

## Overview
Better KeepInventory is a mod that makes it so you only drop loot when killed by players. This helps make servers more engaging by allowing for PVP with looting while still ensuring you don't lose everything after falling into lava. This is currently experimental.

## Versions
The officially supported versions are 1.17.1 and 1.19, however, because the mod is so minimal, many other versions should be supported.
