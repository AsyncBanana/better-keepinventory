# Better KeepInventory

## Overview

Better KeepInventory is a mod that makes it so you only drop loot when killed by players. This helps make servers more engaging by allowing for PVP with looting while still ensuring you don't lose everything after falling into lava. To enable BKI functionality, you must enable keepinventory as you normally would. Deaths caused by players will function as if keepinventory was off, and other deaths will function normally.

## Versions

The officially supported versions are 1.17.1, 1.19, and all 1.20 versions. However, because the mod is so minimal, many other versions should be supported with straightforward modifications.
